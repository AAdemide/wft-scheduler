## üìÖ Project Overview

The **WFT Helper Chrome Extension** is a free, open-source tool designed to bridge the gap between The Home Depot's proprietary **Workforce Tools (WFT) scheduling portal** and your personal **Google Calendar**.

It eliminates the tedious, error-prone process of manually transferring shifts, ensuring your work and personal life are unified in a single, comprehensive view.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Unified Calendar View:** Automatically synchronizes shifts to Google Calendar, merging your work and personal life in one place.
* **Seamless Update:** Shifts are automatically updated in your calendar whenever changes occur on the WFT portal.
* **Flexible Control:** Allows users to **customize** event details (reminders, location) and securely **share or delete** the dedicated work calendar.
* **Smart Data Capture:** Uses the **`webRequest` API** to securely intercept and retrieve reliable JSON data directly from internal Home Depot API endpoints.

## üîí Security and Privacy

Security was a non-negotiable priority, especially when handling user and proprietary data.

* **Local Processing Only:** All data synchronization, token handling, and scheduling logic occurs **exclusively on the user's local device**.
* **Zero External Storage:** **No user data** (shifts, tokens, emails, or API links) is ever stored, transmitted, or logged on external servers.
* **Google OAuth:** Secure authentication is handled entirely via Google's official **OAuth flow** (`chrome.identity`).

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture & Refactoring

This project grew from a simple script into a robust, maintainable application through significant architectural refactoring.

### Core Technology Stack

* **Language:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **APIs:** Chrome Extensions API (`webRequest`, `identity`, `storage`), Google Calendar API (via `gapi.client`)

### Architectural Transition

The initial working script was refactored for **modularity** and **scalability**. We adopted the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern‚Äîa methodology often used in automated testing‚Äîto manage the application's complex interactions with the WFT DOM and proprietary API endpoints.

This structure ensures:
1.  **Clean Separation:** UI management and complex AJAX operations are cleanly abstracted.
2.  **Maintainability:** Easier debugging and future changes without breaking the core sync logic.
